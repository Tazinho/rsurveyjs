Minimal bindings for [SurveyJS v2.x](https://surveyjs.io/) in R/Shiny. ([See also](https://app.unpkg.com/survey-core@2.2.6/files/i18n).)

**rsurveyjs** lets you render and interact with fully customizable surveys, forms and quizzes in Shiny apps using [SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/) v2.

---

## 🚀 Installation

```r
# Install from GitHub
remotes::install_github("Tazinho/rsurveyjs")
```

---

## ✨ Features

- Integrates **SurveyJS v2** in R
- Supports **Shiny input/output** for complete + live responses
- Customize via **CSS variables** using (`theme_vars`)
- Dynamically update widgets via `updateSurveyjs()`
- Supports **readonly**, **initial values**, and **multilingual forms**

---

## 🔧 Usage Example

```r
library(rsurveyjs)

surveyjs(
  schema = list(
    title = "Feedback",
    questions = list(
      list(type = "rating", name = "s", title = "How satisfied are you?"),
      list(type = "text", name = "c", title = "Any comments?")
    )
  ),
  theme_vars = list("--sjs-primary-backcolor" = "#39f"),
  locale = "en",
  live = TRUE
)
```

## 🧪 Shiny Integration

| Feature                 | Shiny Input ID        |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Completed form data     | `input$<id>_data`      |
| Live updates while typing | `input$<id>_data_live` |

## Design Decisions

### No Validation on the R Side

`rsurveyjs` does not perform schema validation in R. This decision is based on the fact that SurveyJS already performs runtime validation in the browser. It catches basic issues like malformed JSON or unknown question types and typically fails gracefully — for example, by skipping invalid questions or logging a console warning. However, also SurveyJS does not enforce strict pre-validation:

* Invalid types like `type = "foo"` fail silently

* `name` is required — it acts as the key in the survey result; without it, the answer is not saved.

* Invalid logic or expressions may only throw errors at runtime

While an unofficial JSON Schema exists, it's not actively maintained. Adding deep validation in R would introduce unnecessary complexity, dependencies, and risk drift from the actual rendering engine.

The philosophy of `rsurveyjs` is to keep things lightweight and trust the developer. If something breaks, it will break at render time — just as it would in a native SurveyJS project.

### Only apply theme variables if the theme is valid

We intentionally apply custom `theme_vars` only when a valid `theme` is provided.

This means:

* If the specified theme is invalid or misspelled, the survey falls back to the default visual style.

* In this case, any `theme_vars` are not applied, since they're assumed to be designed for the intended `theme`.

This avoids applying potentially mismatched styles and helps keep behavior predictable.

## Known limitations so far

* Live results tracking example doesnt work yet > work with onValueChanged > Shiny.setInputValue(...)
* Completion example does not work or is not meaningful > Covered by onComplete + input&<id>_data
* Dynamic Update example does not work or is not meaningful
* error handling
* Provide file upload example - e.g. what to do then with that file?
* provide a shiny database example including testing with db-connection

* Custom widgets / question renderers (needs js-level support, potentially surveyjs plugin, not sure if possible)
* Extending with custom question types
* Embedding in other widgets or layouts
* tests/unit tests for all examples are needed
* switch language on runtime (e.g. via dropown; supproted by surveyjs) (could add a message handler like "surveyjs-locale" - not yet done)
* what are multi-locale surveys?
* does the high level structure for vignettes make sense?
* PDF/Excel/CSV/JSON Export
* work over vignettes (including editing, consistency, cross-linking, examples)

* DSLs e.g. surveyjs_text, surveyjs_number, .. to user friendly, standardizing, encourage best practices
* validation utilities or DSLs like survejs_validator would output the correct pre_render_hook string for that validator, e.g.,

survey.onValidateQuestion.add(function(sender, options) {
  if (options.name === 'nickname' && options.value.length < 4) {
    options.error = 'Too short';
  }
});

4. Theme Builder / Survey Style Options

Your theme and theme_vars support is already great.

You could:

    Offer a helper like surveyjs_theme_vars(primary = "#abc", text = "#333")

    Document how to preview and customize themes

    Possibly add a live theme preview if/when you build a Shiny demo

5. Minimal Test Suite / Examples Gallery

Now is a good time to:

    Create a tests/ folder (if not yet done)

    Add snapshot-based examples using {testthat} or {vdiffr}

    Or: create an "Examples Gallery" vignette with real use cases


What You Could Consider Adding — Carefully
1. Expose Specific Model Methods via Shiny

Useful for reactive apps:
Method	Use Case
clear()	Reset the survey
completeLastPage()	Submit programmatically
isCompleted	Check state

→ Suggestion: Add Shiny message handlers like "surveyjs-clear" or "surveyjs-complete" that call these methods.

You already support surveyModel via el.surveyModel, so this is a natural next step when you do Shiny.
2. Advanced Properties (Optional)

These are power-user settings in x, like:

    showCompletedPage

    showNavigationButtons

    questionTitleLocation

You can allow users to pass extra SurveyJS config like:

surveyjs(..., config = list(showNavigationButtons = FALSE))

And then merge x.config into the Survey model before rendering.

But don't add these until a real user needs them.
3. Events like onComplete

This would allow sending survey data to Shiny or logging it.

If you don’t support Shiny yet, no need to expose it now. When you do, you can add:

survey.onComplete.add(function(sender) {
  Shiny.setInputValue(el.id + "_data", sender.data);
});

Great — here’s a focused checklist of SurveyJS methods and events that are actually useful when you start integrating with Shiny (or any reactive R environment).

These are worth supporting through custom message handlers or exposing in the R API when you need interactivity like resetting surveys, submitting programmatically, or listening for completion.
✅ Methods to Consider (Call from Shiny via session$sendCustomMessage())
Method	What It Does	When to Use in Shiny
survey.clear()	Clears all answers	Reset button or restart flow
survey.completeLastPage()	Triggers completion (like clicking “Complete”)	Auto-submit a survey from R/JS
survey.focusFirstQuestion()	Focus the first input field	Usability: keyboard-first interfaces
survey.nextPage()	Programmatically move to next page	Custom navigation buttons
survey.prevPage()	Go to previous page	Custom “Back” button
survey.getQuestionByName("x")	Access question programmatically	For advanced UI control or overrides
Example: Call clear() from Shiny

In JS (you already expose el.surveyModel):

Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler("surveyjs-clear", function(message) {
  const el = document.getElementById(message.el);
  if (el && el.surveyModel) {
    el.surveyModel.clear();
  }
});

<!-- In R: -->

<!-- session$sendCustomMessage("surveyjs-clear", list(el = "survey_id")) -->

<!-- ✅ Events to Add for Shiny Interop -->
<!-- Event	Purpose	When to Use -->
<!-- onComplete	Send results to Shiny when survey is done	Capture responses in server -->
<!-- onValueChanged	Live-update an input binding	Track form progress reactively -->
<!-- Example: Live updates -->

<!-- survey.onValueChanged.add(function(sender, options) { -->
<!--   Shiny.setInputValue(el.id + "_data_live", sender.data, { priority: "event" }); -->
<!-- }); -->

<!-- And final submission: -->

<!-- survey.onComplete.add(function(sender) { -->
<!--   Shiny.setInputValue(el.id + "_data", sender.data); -->
<!-- }); -->

<!-- Then in R: -->

<!-- input$survey_id_data      # final completed data -->
<!-- input$survey_id_data_live # updated continuously -->


    <!-- onComplete, onValueChanged -->

    <!-- Maybe nextPage()/prevPage() for custom buttons -->
