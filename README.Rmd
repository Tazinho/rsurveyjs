## 🧪 Shiny Integration Quick Reference

| Feature                   | Shiny Input ID        |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Completed form data       | `input$<id>_data`    |
| Live updates (typing)     | `input$<id>_data_live` |

See [Shiny and Database Integration](articles/shiny-and-database-integration.html) for advanced use.

## 🚦 Design Philosophy & Limitations

- **No R-side validation:**  
  - Schema validation and error handling is performed in the browser by SurveyJS itself.
- **Custom widgets/plugins:**  
  - Official support for registering new question types from R is not included.  
  - Power users can inject JavaScript via `pre_render_hook` and related arguments.  
    See the [Advanced JS Hooks & Events vignette](articles/advanced-js-hooks--events.html).
- **File uploads, Survey Creator, PDF export:**  
  - Not included, but see the vignettes and [SurveyJS docs](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/) for guidance and alternatives.

> **Advanced: Custom JavaScript and Custom Widgets**
>
> - rsurveyjs allows you to inject any JavaScript code via `pre_render_hook`, `post_render_hook`, and `complete_hook`.
> - Advanced users can use these hooks to register [SurveyJS custom widgets or plugins](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/custom-widget), add event listeners, or extend survey logic—provided you are familiar with the SurveyJS JavaScript API.
> - **Note:** There is currently no high-level R API for defining or registering new question types from R code alone.  
>   Custom widget support is available *for power users only*, via JavaScript hooks.  
> - For real-world JS examples, see the [Advanced JS Hooks & Events vignette](articles/advanced-js-hooks--events.html).
